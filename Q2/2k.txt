The inadmissible heuristic picked was the squared Euclidean. A figure of the calculated policy is shown below: (SEE IMAGE)

Comparing the two policies, the inadmissible heuristic made a difference in the center of the map where different policies converged. 
The optimal policy was incorrectly calculated to be magenta when an admissible heuristic should calculate it to be red or green.
Additionally, the boundary between the red/green, green/magenta and blue/magenta areas are slightly different when compared to the 
admissible heuristic.
