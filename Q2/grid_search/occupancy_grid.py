# This class stores the occupancy grid. This is a "chessboard-like"
# representation of the environment. The environment is represented by
# a set of square cells. Each cell encodes whether that bit of the
# environment is free, or whether it is blocked. A "0" says that a
# cell is free and so the robot can travel over it. A "1" means that
# it is blocked and the robot cannot travel over it.
